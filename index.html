        A blank ballot is a ballot which has been handed in with no votes
        recorded on it.<br />

        An undervote occurs when the number of choices selected by a voter in a
        contest is less than the maximum number allowed for that contest or
        when no selection is made for a single choice contest. (Wikipedia)<br />

        An overvote occurs when one votes for more than the maximum number of
        selections allowed in a contest. (Wikipedia)<br />
